Resume
======

This is the source of my resume.
If you were interested in the compiled PDF it is [here](http://isaacgoss.com/resume.pdf).
I write it in LaTeX, because I believe it gives me complete control over the layout, and allows me to do version control with git.
Plus I just like LaTeX and other plain-text formats.
Please check out [my website](http://isaacgoss.com) for more on me, and explore this GitHub to check out what I have been working on.
